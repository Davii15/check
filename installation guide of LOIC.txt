**Title: Compiling and Running LOIC on Kali Linux (2023)**

---

**Overview:**
This guide walks you through compiling the LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon) DDoS testing tool from source on a Kali Linux 2023 system using Mono. LOIC is strictly for testing within controlled environments.

---

### Prerequisites:

* Kali Linux (2023 or later)
* Internet access (temporarily enable NAT or Bridged mode in VirtualBox)
* Git and Mono installed

---

### Step 1: Update Kali Linux

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

> **Note:** If you encounter a public key error, run:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys <MISSING-KEY-ID>
```

Replace `<MISSING-KEY-ID>` with the actual key ID provided in the error.

---

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

```bash
sudo apt install git mono-complete -y
```

---

### Step 3: Clone the LOIC GitHub Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC.git
cd LOIC
```

---

### Step 4: Compile LOIC

```bash
xbuild LOIC.sln
```

> Output will be saved in:
> `LOIC/bin/Debug/LOIC.exe` (or Release depending on config)

---

### Step 5: Run LOIC

```bash
cd bin/Debug
mono LOIC.exe
```

---

### Optional: Hivemind Mode (IRC)

To start LOIC in Hivemind mode:

```bash
mono LOIC.exe /hivemind irc.example.com
```

To run without GUI (headless):

```bash
mono LOIC.exe /hidden /hivemind irc.example.com
```

---

### Important Notes:

* Do **not** use LOIC on public networks or external IPs without consent.
* Use in isolated environments like OWASP Broken Web Apps or DVWA.
* Only perform tests against machines you legally control.

ssuming you have Ubuntu/Debian:

Download latest LOIC and extract.
Open a terminal and type (without the parenthesis) ‚Äúsudo apt-get install wine‚Äù and wait for it to finish.
Type ‚Äúwget http://www.kegel.com/wine/winetricks‚Äù.
Type ‚Äúsh winetricks‚Äù and from the GUI select dotnet20, and install it.
Go to applications on your drop down and under Wine click on ‚ÄúBrowse C: drive‚Äù then move the extracted LOIC to c:
Now, go to the extracted file and right-click LOIC.exe and click properties.
Go to permissions tab and check the box ‚ÄúAllow executing this file as program‚Äù.
Right click file again and under open application, select wine.
Addendum: Please refer to this issue for more recent instructions on getting wine installed on our system: LOIC#83

Wine instructions doesnt work directly as it mentioned here it needs some improvements:

There is Wine64 and Wine32 , apt install wine it will install wine64 because Debian and most distros deprecating/not using by default i386 architecture, so user need to specify the wine version.

Better refer the user to install wine on debian from the official website of winehq:

https://wiki.winehq.org/Debian

(why do we need 32bit? because loic architecture is 32bit)

ü•á Best Option: Download the Precompiled .exe
Use the version from the original author‚Äôs archive, which is easier to run:

NewEraCracker's LOIC GitHub

Navigate to the Releases section or find a .zip with a ready-to-use LOIC.exe.

Then use Wine on Kali:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install wine
wine LOIC.exe
ERROR, found the error the following packages have unmet depedencies :
kali-desktop-xfce : Depedends : kali-desktop-core but it isn ot going to be installed 
e: Error, pkgProblemResolver :: Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages


 Step-by-Step Fix for ‚ÄúUnmet Dependencies‚Äù in Kali Linux
1. Update and Upgrade First
Run this to make sure all your package information is up-to-date:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
If you see any errors related to missing public keys, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys <KEY_ID>
(Replace <KEY_ID> with the actual key in the error, like A1234...)

2. Fix Broken/Held Packages
Sometimes packages get "held" and block upgrades or installs.

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt --fix-broken install
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt-mark showhold
If any packages are listed as held, you can unhold them:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt-mark unhold kali-desktop-core
3. Try Installing Wine Again
Now try installing Wine:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install wine -y
Alternatively, install minimal Wine version:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install --install-recommends wine32 wine64 -y
4. If Still Broken ‚Äì Force Dependency Resolution
As a last resort, force it:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo aptitude install wine64
(Aptitude is more intelligent than apt and can offer solutions. If it‚Äôs not installed, run sudo apt install aptitude first.)

Let me know the exact point where it fails if you still see errors. I can walk you through alternative routes or prepare a minimal Wine .deb installer./




**Conclusion:**
You now have LOIC compiled and running on Kali Linux 2023. Always use these tools ethically and legally for cybersecurity training, penetration testing, and research.
