‚öôÔ∏è Tools You Can Use (from Kali Linux):
hping3 ‚Äì Advanced TCP/IP packet crafter (layer 3)

slowloris ‚Äì App-layer DoS using slow HTTP headers

LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon) ‚Äì GUI-based traffic flooder

GoldenEye ‚Äì Layer 7 HTTP DoS tester

Metasploit auxiliary modules ‚Äì Useful for simulated stress tests

üîß Example: Simulating DoS on OWASP BWA with hping3
Let‚Äôs say OWASP BWA is at 192.168.56.101.

Run the following from Kali Linux:

bash
Copy
Edit
hping3 -S --flood -V -p 80 192.168.56.101
-S: Sends SYN packets (simulates SYN flood)

--flood: Sends packets as fast as possible

-p 80: Targeting HTTP port

-V: Verbose

‚ö†Ô∏è This may slow or crash lightweight test servers depending on your VM resources.

üêå Using slowloris (Layer 7 DoS)
Install it:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/gkbrk/slowloris
cd slowloris
python3 slowloris.py 192.168.56.101
This exploits HTTP keep-alive connections, often effective against Apache-based servers.

üî• Using GoldenEye
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/jseidl/GoldenEye
cd GoldenEye
python3 goldeneye.py http://192.168.56.101 -w 50 -s 100
-w 50: Number of workers

-s 100: Number of sockets per worker

üìà Monitor OWASP Server Response
On the OWASP BWA machine (or Kali):

bash
Copy
Edit
top
iftop
netstat -anp
Check for:

High CPU or RAM usage

High number of open sockets

Unresponsive web interface

üõ°Ô∏è What Makes OWASP BWA Vulnerable to DoS?
Lack of request throttling

No rate limiting

No Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Weak connection-handling in PHP/Apache stack

üß™ Bonus: Use Metasploit for HTTP DoS
bash
Copy
Edit
msfconsole
use auxiliary/dos/http/goldeneye
set RHOST 192.168.56.101
run
üß† Final Notes
Always test in an isolated lab.

Monitor both client and server VMs to study behavior under stress.

These tests do not fully mimic distributed attacks (like botnets), but are sufficient for simulating typical DoS symptoms.

Would you like me to generate a checklist report from these steps?








You said:
can you explain into details or like you are explaining to a naive tech person what slowloris and GoldenEye are briefly,


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs a simple, beginner-friendly explanation of what Slowloris and GoldenEye do, and why they matter in testing web servers like OWASP BWA:

üêå What is Slowloris?
Slowloris is like a person who starts talking... very slowly, and never finishes their sentence.

üîç What does it do?
It sends incomplete web requests to a server (like a website).

The server is waiting for those requests to finish.

But they never finish, and the server holds on to them.

Eventually, the server runs out of space to talk to real users.

üéØ What does this mean?
If enough fake (slow) requests are made, the server becomes too busy to help real people.

The website might become slow or even crash.

üõ†Ô∏è Why is this useful in testing?
Helps you see if your server can handle slow clients.

Helps you decide if you need a firewall, rate-limiting, or protection system.

ü¶Ö What is GoldenEye?
GoldenEye is like a group of people walking into a store and asking a ton of questions at once, trying to overwhelm the staff.

üîç What does it do?
It sends a lot of web traffic (fake visits) to a website all at once.

It creates many connections, each doing multiple fake actions.

This floods the server with requests, like a traffic jam.

üéØ What does this mean?
The website gets too many fake visitors and can't keep up.

It slows down or crashes under the pressure.

üõ†Ô∏è Why is this useful in testing?
Shows how many users your site can handle.

Helps you prepare for traffic spikes or attacks.

Helps you test if your server can block abusive traffic.

üß† In Simple Terms:
Tool	Like...	Goal
Slowloris	A person who talks very slowly forever	Fills up server slots with half-done chats
GoldenEye	A crowd shouting all at once	Overwhelms the server with fake visitors

Both tools are used in safe, ethical hacking environments (like your test lab with OWASP BWA) to learn:

‚úÖ How strong your web server is
‚úÖ Where it breaks under pressure
‚úÖ How to fix and protect it before bad actors try

Would you like these simplified notes in a PDF or DOCX file for sharing with your team or NGO peers?







You said:
do we have other tools to test like the two mentioned above since i also have metasp[loit server which is also hosted on my virtual enviroment which i also need to see its resilience on such ddos, be brief, o


ChatGPT said:
Yes, here are other popular DDoS testing tools you can use alongside Slowloris and GoldenEye, especially in a controlled lab like yours:

üõ†Ô∏è 1. LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon)
Sends massive HTTP, TCP, or UDP requests.

Very easy to use GUI.

Good for testing basic server load handling.

üõ†Ô∏è 2. HOIC (High Orbit Ion Cannon)
More powerful than LOIC.

Supports ‚Äúboosters‚Äù (scripts) to increase the attack effect.

Tests application-level resilience.

üõ†Ô∏è 3. Hping3
Command-line tool.

Sends custom TCP, UDP, ICMP packets.

Useful for simulating SYN floods or fragmentation attacks.

üõ†Ô∏è 4. XERXES
Developed by a famous hacktivist (anonymous use).

High-efficiency tool for raw DDoS simulation.

Good for testing how fast the server fails.

üõ†Ô∏è 5. Metasploit Auxiliary Modules
Since you have Metasploit:

You can use modules like:

bash
Copy
Edit
auxiliary/dos/http/slowloris  
auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood  
auxiliary/dos/udp/udp_flood
These simulate different DDoS layers (application, TCP, UDP).

Let me know if you want a ready lab test plan or want these tools summarized in a PDF/DOCX.







You said:
you can include them into a pdf format and how each tool can be used or implemented, so that i can test them later for my OWASP web server, and metasploit broken server, and if possible you can include a simulated expected output from these tools if possible, you can include the slowloris and the golden eye also in that list,

Goloris - slowloris[1] for nginx DoS
FAQ
Features

Uses as low network bandwidth as possible.
Low CPU and memory usage.
Automatically and silently eats all the available TCP connections to the server.
Supports https.
Easily hackable thanks to clear and concise Go syntax and powerful Golang features.
Limitations

Can eat up to 64K TCP connections from a single IP due to TCP limitations. Just use proxies if you want overcoming this limitation :)
How it works?

It tries occupying and keeping busy as much tcp connections to the victim as possible by using as low network bandwidth as possible. If goloris is lucky enough, then eventually it should eat all the available connections to the victim, so no other client could connect to it. See the source code for more insights.

How quickly it can take down unprotected nginx with default settings?

In a few minutes with default config options.

Which versions of nginx are vulnerable?

All up to 1.5.9 if unprotected as described below (i.e. with default config).

How to protect nginx against goloris?

I know the following options:

Limit the number of simultaneous TCP connections from the same source ip. See, for example, connlimit in iptables or http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_conn_module.html
Deny POST requests.
Patch nginx, so it drops connection if the client sends POST body at very slow rate.
How to use it?

//LOIC USAGE IN MY KALI LINUX system,
‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step: Setting up LOIC on Kali Linux (for VirtualBox Testing)
‚úÖ WARNING: Do not run LOIC on a public network or against real servers. This guide assumes you're in a fully offline virtual lab using host-only adapters.

1. Set Up Your Virtual Environment
Ensure you have:

‚úÖ Kali Linux VM (attacker)

‚úÖ OWASP BWA or DVWA VM (target)

‚úÖ Host-Only Network in VirtualBox (no internet access, only internal)

Go to each VM ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Adapter 2 ‚Üí Set to Host-only Adapter

2. Install .NET and Mono (Required for LOIC)
LOIC is a Windows tool, so we use Mono to run it on Kali Linux.

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mono-complete -y
3. Download LOIC Source Code or Binary
Option A ‚Äì Clone from GitHub:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC.git
cd LOIC
Option B ‚Äì Download the .exe:

Visit: https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/releases

Download the LOIC.exe file manually

Move it to your Kali machine

4. Run LOIC Using Mono
If you have LOIC.exe, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mono LOIC.exe
This will launch the LOIC GUI (yes, it works in Kali using Mono GUI support).

If the GUI doesn‚Äôt launch, try installing:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install libmono-winforms2.0-cil
5. Set Target (OWASP VM IP)
From your OWASP VM:

bash
Copy
Edit
ip a
Look for something like 192.168.56.102 (your host-only IP)

Back in LOIC GUI on Kali:

Target URL/IP: 192.168.56.102

Method: TCP / HTTP / UDP

Port: 80

Message: Anything (e.g., test123)

Timeouts: Leave defaults

‚úÖ Then click IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER (this starts the flood).

‚úÖ Simulating the Effect
From OWASP VM (or browser):

Try loading http://localhost/ or http://192.168.56.102

During LOIC attack, it should become slow or unresponsive

You can also run:

bash
Copy
Edit
top
or

bash
Copy
Edit
htop
to observe CPU/memory usage spiking on OWASP.

üîê Ensure Safe Containment
Use host-only network

Do not allow bridge/NAT networking on the Kali machine

Never test against real domains or public IPs

‚ö†Ô∏è Ethics & Legality Reminder
LOIC is flagged as a potentially illegal tool when misused. Use only in controlled lab environments for learning.
//using hoic for my enviroments.
HOIC is a Windows .NET GUI app, so to run on Kali Linux:

Install Mono (if not already):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update && sudo apt install mono-complete -y
Download HOIC from GitHub:

Search: HOIC Github ‚Üí Find from reputable forks like:

https://github.com/MatrixEditor/HOIC

Or use older mirrors (if safe).

Save HOIC.exe to your Kali Linux VM.

Run in Mono GUI:

bash
Copy
Edit
mono HOIC.exe
üß™ How to Use HOIC (Basic Testing)
Launch the GUI

Click "Add Target"

Target URL: http://192.168.56.102 (your OWASP BWA IP)

Power: HIGH (or lower for stability)

Booster: Optional .hoic script (adds headers/variability)

Threads: Set between 10-100 for local testing

Press FIRE TEH LAZER!

Observe OWASP BWA for slowdowns or temporary unavailability.


How to Safely Use HOIC in Kali / VirtualBox
If you are determined to experiment with HOIC, follow these precise and safe steps within your isolated lab environment:

Step 1: Download from SourceForge
Visit the download link:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/high-orbit-ion-cannon/ 
youtube.com
+13
sourceforge.net
+13
github.com
+13

This ZIP includes both binary and source code.

Step 2: Transfer to Kali and Prepare
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update && sudo apt install mono-complete wine unrar -y
wget <sourceforge_link>/HOIC.zip
unrar x HOIC.zip
wine is used for running Windows executables (.exe) on Linux.

mono may not reliably run HOIC (it's primarily Windows/.NET).

Step 3: Launch the HOIC GUI Safely
In Kali terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
wine HOIC.exe
‚úì It should open the GUI window.

Step 4: Configure Attack Parameters
Add the OWASP VM‚Äôs IP (192.168.56.x) as your Target

Set a moderate Power level and choose a booster (optional)

Choose a thread count (e.g. 10‚Äì50)

Click ‚ÄúFIRE TEH LAZER!‚Äù

üß† Monitor CPU/network usage on OWASP VM to observe impact

Step 5: Strict Safety Measures
Use Host‚ÄëOnly Adapter only‚Äîno internet access

Never point to public or production IPs

Install a virtual firewall rule blocking internet-facing outbound connections from Kali

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Risks
HOIC is more powerful and stealthy than LOIC, especially with booster scripts 


Because of its HTTP flood capabilities and obfuscation, even a single instance can significantly impact vulnerable web services 


This tool is designed for HTTP-level floods and is not effective for TCP/UDP floods; it can nullify WAFs via randomized payloads 

 2. Fix the Public Key Error
If you now have internet, fix GPG key issue:

üîπ Option A: Use Kali's Automatic Key Fetcher
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys <KEY_ID>
You can extract the <KEY_ID> from the error message. It looks like:

nginx
Copy
Edit
NO_PUBKEY ABCD1234EFGH5678
Then you‚Äôd run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys ABCD1234EFGH5678
‚úÖ 3. Update Kali Properly
Once key issue is resolved:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
üõ† Common Tips:
If you're behind a proxy or firewall, ensure ports 80 and 443 are open.

To regenerate your sources list:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Paste this for Kali (2023+):

plaintext
Copy
Edit
deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
Save and exit, then:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
